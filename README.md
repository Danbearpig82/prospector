This is a Minecraft datapack created for the upcoming 1.18 Caves & Cliffs Part 2 update, developed using Mojang's Caves & Cliffs Preview datapack. This pack adds realistic ore surveys for copper and iron, similar to surface electrical resistivity surveys. Master-level cartographer villagers will offer survey spikes for trade in exchange for emeralds. There are two varieties, one calibrated for iron ore and the other calibrated for copper ore. Right-click on the ground while holding these and a survey will be conducted of all copper or iron ore blocks in the chunk you are standing in, and then a banner will be placed to mark the ore concentration in that chunk. Copper surveys will have an orange banner, while iron surveys will have a gray banner. Ore concentration will be noted by a colored stripe on the banner:

White - Very low concentration (0-50 blocks)
Yellow - Low concentration (51-100 blocks)
Orange - Moderate concentration (101-150 blocks)
Red - High concentration (151-200 blocks)
Black - Very high concentration (201+ blocks)

As of the 21w18a snapshot, ore concentrations in the huge ore veins can sometimes reach 300 and in rare cases even 400 blocks. This offers an alternate way to find these veins instead of caving, while not providing an automatic "easy button" but allowing players to conduct realistic subsurface surveys with high-tech tools. In testing, I have found that an effective survey technique is to go either north/south or east/west, surveying every other chunk in a line until you find moderate or better concentration, and then optionally surveying every chunk in the area to find the extent of the ore vein. Right click the banners with a map to keep track, and lock that map with a pane of glass in a cartography table then remove the banners if you don't want other players to see the results of your ore surveys.

Feedback and issue reports are appreciated, and happy prospecting!
